# Stranger - a man without name
A man without name plays the leading role in the movie *A Fistful of Dollars* \(1964\), which is centered around a war between two families: the deadly and devilish Rojo brothers and The Baxters, a slightly more honorable outfit.

Actor Clint Eastwood played the role of the man with no name: a stranger comes into town looking for work and becomes involved in a bloody feud. While he is not exactly a traditional hero, he is acting in his own interest for much of the pictureâ€”he is ultimately more of a good man than the people he faces down the barrel of a gun.
